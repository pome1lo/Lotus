## Introduction

Lotus is designed to be a high-performance, scalable solution for modern web applications, leveraging the power of microservices and a reactive user interface. It's built with flexibility in mind, allowing for seamless integration with various databases and messaging systems.

## Architecture

The Lotus architecture is composed of several independent microservices that communicate over gRPC and RabbitMQ. Each service is responsible for a discrete aspect of the application, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

## Technologies

- **Backend**: Koa.js for building RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic.
- **Frontend**: React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ for reliable message brokering between services.
- **Inter-Service Communication**: gRPC for efficient and type-safe service-to-service communication.
- **Databases**: SQL Server and MongoDB for structured and unstructured data storage.
